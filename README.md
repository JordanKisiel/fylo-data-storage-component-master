## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use absolute positioning to have an element escape and overlap its containing element. I also learned how to use borders to create a triangle shape (in this case to aid in creating a speech bubble effect) purely in CSS. This does, however, feel a little hacky and I wonder if there's a better approach. I also learned about the meter HTML element but I wasn't able to make it look how I wanted so I had to use a div and span method to create a meter instead.

### Continued development

I'd like to try some more complex layouts that require the use of absolute positioning to create.

### Useful resources
